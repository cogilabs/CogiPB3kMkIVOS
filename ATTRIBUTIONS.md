## Fallout Assets

### Vault Boy GIF (Main Screen)
Created by me (**David Girou**) using original gameplay screenshots from *Fallout 76*.  
The resulting animation was captured, cropped, and converted into a looping GIF for use within this fan-made interface project.  
All rights to the original character and visuals belong to Bethesda Softworks.

### Perk Images (GIFs & PNGs)
Most perk images were sourced from the [Independent Fallout Wiki](https://fallout.wiki/), which hosts visual assets extracted from various Fallout games.  
Original artwork © Bethesda Softworks / ZeniMax Media.

A few perk illustrations (3 GIFs and 3 PNGs) were **modified by me** to replace the Vault-Tec jumpsuit number **“111”** with **“451”**, in reference to the theme of this project.  
These edits were made for non-commercial fan use only.

### Armor Image Set
Composite images created by me from screenshots taken in *Fallout 76*.  
The base character (Vault Boy in underwear) and armor pieces are in-game visuals, rearranged and isolated for use within this fan-made interface project.  
Original artwork © Bethesda Softworks / ZeniMax Media.

### Item Images
All item images (weapons, ammunition, consumables, etc.) were sourced from the [Independent Fallout Wiki](https://fallout.wiki/).  
They originate from in-game assets owned by Bethesda Softworks.
