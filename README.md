## ⚠️ Warning: Work in Progress ⚠️

The **Cogilabs Pip-Boy 3000 Mk4** is a version of Fallout 4's Pip-Boy I'm making for cosplay purposes.

## Introduction

The project is really in two parts:

- The OS, which I'm remaking from scratch in Electron. It will be mostly functionnal.
- The object itself, which will be a Raspberry Pi 4 encased in a 3D printed Pip-Boy, I will modify a model from the internet which will be credited here later.

For the moment I'm waiting for the delivery of my components, so I'm working on the OS, enjoy some screenshots!  

## Screenshots

On the Status page, the vault-boy is a gif, and the level is automatically calculated as your age, directly in function of your date of birth:

Note the footers for the inventory tabs:

![Inv/aid](/readme_sources/images/aid.png)  
  
For the Data and Map tabs, the footer gives the date and time, so the Pip-Boy could even be used as a watch:

For the Map, since it's mostly for cosplays during conventions, I tested with a low-resolution version of the map of my city's last year local convention, just to see. The CSS filters work great to make a "Pip-Boyified" map with any image:

For the Radio, I put the games radios as "unreachable" and my own radio as the only working one. For the graph, it's randomly generated, I plan to try to smooth it more:

This settings page allows you to customize you Pip-Boy screen colors.

This allows for neat configs like this one for my fiancee who wants one too.
